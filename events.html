					<h3>Souper Bowl of Caring</h3><br>
					Visit your local H-E-B store for an easy way to give during this ongoing fundraising drive. #TackleHunger at your local H-E-B<br>
					Souper Bowl of Caring is a national movement of individuals working to fight hunger and poverty in their own communities around the time of the Super Bowl. In the weeks leading up to the big game, individuals and groups take up collections, asking for one dollar or one item of food for people in need. They give 100% of their donation directly to the local hunger-relief charity of their choice.

				<h3>Turkeys Tackling Hunger</h3><br>
				Thanksgiving is a time of gratitude; a time to share a special meal with friends and family. But what does Thanksgiving mean to the estimated 25,000 food insecure residents of Hays County? When you're worried about putting a routine dinner on the table, a full Thanksgiving meal can be a source of great stress. That's where Hays County Food Bank, along with your help, can offer a helping hand.
				For just $30, you can help fill one family's dinner table.
