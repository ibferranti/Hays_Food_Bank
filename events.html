				<h3>Souper Bowl of Caring</h3><br>
				Visit your local H-E-B store for an easy way to give during this ongoing fundraising drive. #TackleHunger at your local H-E-B<br>
				Souper Bowl of Caring is a national movement of individuals working to fight hunger and poverty in their own communities around the time of the Super Bowl. In the weeks leading up to the big game, individuals and groups take up collections, asking for one dollar or one item of food for people in need. They give 100% of their donation directly to the local hunger-relief charity of their choice.

				<h3>Amplify Austin</h3><br>
				Amplify Austin Day is the annual community-wide day of online giving. This 24-hour period provides an easy and fun way for the entire community to give together while helping local nonprofits.<br>
				Donate between 6:00 PM on March 5th and 6:00 PM on March 6th and the food bank will have a chance at special prizes throughout the event.

				<h3>Spring Harvest Healthy Food Drive Challenge</h3><br>
				We hope to encourage the donation of fresh foods, thus increasing our clients' access to nutritious options, raise awareness about hunger by reminding Hays County residents that their neighbors benefit from food assistance year-round, and recognize the hard work that competing teams are doing by giving them the chance to house our traveling trophy for one year.
